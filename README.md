# project-template

I created this project long time ago. It was used to store the most useful tools and testing new technologies. 
Also, I started using this template to show as the code examples as well.

UPD: Currentely, I have been workin with my new "Pet" [Compose Multiplatform Project](https://github.com/stasoption/ComposeMultiplatformCoinTracker)
